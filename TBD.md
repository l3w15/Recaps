#### How would you use it?
* Steel thread in POC to touch on all areas of project while essentially hardcoding some features.
    * For example not splitting drink name and price

#### What would you tell yourself when using  it?
* Get 360 feedback in project review (feedback from superiors, peers, customers) perceptions might not fit with reality.
* Get over it being commercial, try your best, don't be an a***, 
* Consultancy is similar to a pyramid scheme. 
* Be client, IW and self focused (3 lenses).
